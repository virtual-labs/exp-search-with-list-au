Breadth first search explores the space level by level only when there are no more states to be explored at a given level does the algorithm move on to the next level.

We implement BFS using lists open and closed to keep track of progress through the state space. In the order list, the elements will be those who have been generated but whose children have not been examined. The closed list records the states that have been examined and whose children have been generated. The order of removing the states from the open list will be the order of searching. The open is maintained as a queue on the first in first out data structure. States are added to the right of the list and removed from the left
